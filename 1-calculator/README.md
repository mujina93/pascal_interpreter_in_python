# Part 1 - arithmetic expressions interpreter (calculator)
Run with
```
python3 calc1.py
```
and input some simple expressions of the form INTEGER SIGN INTEGER (there can be whitespaces before, between, and after. They will be correctly ignored by the interpreter, which will parse just the numbers and the sign)
```
calc> 3 + 4
7
calc>    8 *   2
16
```
